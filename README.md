Dual Source Charger
=============
Currently seeking a new, flashier name.

This project is a dual power source charger that breaks out to 3.3v and 5v.

An example use case would be a solar panel or usb connection to charge a lipo driving an ESP8266 or an Arduino.

The dual power circuit is mostly taken from https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/ESPlant
